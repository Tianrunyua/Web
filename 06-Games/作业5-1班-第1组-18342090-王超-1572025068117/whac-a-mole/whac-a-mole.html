    Features: 
    1. All features required by the homework
    2. More user-friendly UI with SVG animation

    Notes:
    1. It's my first attempt to use SVG animation to build Web UI.
       The animated radio buttons was implemented by Tympanus Codrops: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/10/15/animated-checkboxes-and-radio-buttons-with-svg.
       The progressive button was also implemented by Tympanus: https://tympanus.net/Development/ProgressButtonStyles/.
       Although the articles are written in 2013, the animation effects still look COOL nowadays.
       Thank you Tympanus! This website is full of creative web designs with impressive implementations.
    
    2. It's also my first attempt to use window.requestAnimationFrame.
       The main reason is...I don't want to manage CSS Transition/Animation on my own.
       Syncing my timer with CSS Animation sounds a little bit troublesome.
    
    3. Yeah it's always Microsoft Edge that likes to behave differently from other browsers.
       Since MSEdge doesn't support ::before pesudo element of <input>, I had to implement the customized radio button styles using ::-ms-check,
       which only allows a subset of CSS properties excluding transition. So there will be a small difference between MSEdge and other modern browsers.
